                        <p>Certifications can validate your IT skills and experience to show employers you have the expertise to get the job done. You can get certified in skills you already have or skills you'd like to put to use in your career — whatever your reason, certifications are a great way to strengthen your resume and set yourself apart from other candidates in a job search.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) certification is offered through the International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC)².

It's designed for those working with cloud technology including enterprise architects, security administrators, systems engineers, security architects, systems architects or consultants, engineers or managers.

While not required, the (ISC)² recommends having at least five years of experience in IT, with at least three years in information security and one year in one or more of the six domains found in the CCSP CBOK.</p>
